    <p>FlexStream’s powerful secure and tracked email service is built for sensitive business documents. 
    With FlexStream’s extensive audit, tracking, and follow-up functionalities, it’s now easier than ever 
    to select the documents to be emailed and be confident they will reach their intended recipients 
    untouched.</p>
    <h4><strong>Channel Selection</strong></h4>
    <p>FlexStream has output management features that allow you to process documents and distribute them
    using multiple methods: email, secure and tracked email, output to printer or PDF-file, and archiving.</p>
    <p>FlexStream allows you to select which documents from a document stream you want to be emailed, 
    based on information contained in the document or over a linked database. This allows for a 
    transition from paper to email based on your or the recipients preferences.</p>
    <h4><strong>Secure Email</strong></h4>
    <p>Secure and tracked email is a simple and cost effective method by which you can safely send 
    documents, even very large files, over the Internet in a secure, managed and audited manner. 
    All attachments are encrypted to ensure complete confidentiality using high-grade encryption 
    algorithms.</p>
    <p>Recipients receive a personalized, standard email containing a link, which is used to access 
    their encrypted file held on the secure server and download the content over a secure &lpar;HTTPS&rpar; 
    Internet connection.</p>
    <h4><strong>Tracking, Audit and Follow-up</strong></h4>
    <p>With full delivery and receipt audit reporting included, you are able to track and trace the 
    document throughout the delivery process. FlexStream will show you time of sending, delivery, 
    and the date and time the attached document was opened by the recipient.</p>
    <p>If you have sent the document through secure and tracked email, and the recipient does not 
    open it within a certain time frame, which you can monitor through the built-in audit process,
    you can choose to reissue using the same or a different method. Audit reports can be exported.</p>
    <p>The sophisticated SSLPost service ensures maximum security with end-to-end encryption electronic
    mail and a highly secure delivery environment. FlexStream offers this system of processes as a public
    Software as a Service &lpar;SaaS&rpar; solution.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Significantly reduce costs by saving printing, material, and postage.</li>
        <li>No investment in email infrastructure required, no email server needed. No special setup, 
        the service can be used without intervention of IT specialists. No worries about becoming 
        blacklisted when sending large amounts of emails.</li>
        <li>No workflow intervention. Processes PDF-documents generated by any system. Complete flexibility
        in selecting documents to be emailed.</li>
        <li>Securely send emails with attached documents up to 6Mb. Sending large document attachments 
        in this manner will prevent any blocking by the recipient’s email server because of file 
        attachment size limits or other email settings.</li>
        <li>Track and trace sent emails with no recipient intervention. Recording of date and time the 
        email was sent, delivered, and when the attached document was opened and read.</li>
        <li>Easy to use for the recipient. Looks like a ‘normal’ email and can be used without additional 
        software installed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pricing is based on  pay-per-email with no fixed costs for the service. FlexStream&trade;
    Secure &amp; Tracked email offers packages for both high and low volumes, ensuring the service is a worthwhile 
    purchase no matter your company’s size or needs. Contact a Blazar account representative to
