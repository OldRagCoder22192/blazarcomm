    <p>The introduction of API's has made it very simple for software companies to write interfaces 
    into UPS, FedEx, USPS and DHL. By using the programming interface it saves the developer from having to 
    build a rating engine to manage shipping rates internally so they are able to bring a very basic product 
    to market for a low cost. These products work fine for very basic desktop shipping and low volume (20 a day) 
    e-commerce sites.</p>
    <p>BlazarShip is designed for a complex product warehouse environment or desktop shipping across your enterprise.
    With a few &ldquo;flips of the switch&rdquo;  our platform can be configured to ship everything from overnight
    legal documents to truckloads of machine parts.</p>
    <p>We have the ability to utilize the API or create the carrier rate tables internally depending on your 
    requirements. Last year BlazarShip's processing engine handled 280,000 shipments per day for a 
    name brand electronics company (that you would recognize) during the holiday season without one single
    glitch. We can also configure the platform to handle custom/regional small parcel and LTL carriers.</p>
