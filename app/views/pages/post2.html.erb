    <h2>Is Insourcing or Outsourcing Best For Your Document Management Needs?</h2>
    <h4>Blazar offers both!</h4>
    
    <h2>IN-HOUSE PROCESSING</h2>
    <h3>Why In-House?</h3>
    <p>Some companies are a bit wary of sending their secure customer database outside of their control for processing.
    Blazar understands your need for a more hands-on approach to secure document management. There are many other benefits to 
    processing your customer communications on an in-house basis as well. Blazar takes into consideration cost, 
    quality, and production control as well.</p>
    <h3>Fixed Equipment and Labor Costs</h3>
    <p>When you have everything you need in-house to process your customer communications, you enjoy something that 
    outsourcing companies simply can't provide: economies of scale. Since your equipment and labor costs are fixed, the 
    more customer communications documents you send out, the lower your cost per piece is due to the fixed payment pricing. Many 
    outsourcing companies have hidden fees for every job change, additional insert, etc. and outsource customers don't really 
    know how much the job is going to cost until they get the bill. Typically, customers are given a menu of prices and breakdowns 
    that with some outsource companies add up to a significant cost per piece in the end. In other words, the more you run, the more 
    you pay those outside companies. With in-house production, you always know exactly what you're going to pay.</p>
    <p>Postal cost control is another huge benefit to implementing vendor supplied and USPS approved postal discounting software 
    for your first class and promotional customer communications. In many cases, the postal discounts captured from the USPS 
    matches a significant portion of the lease payment for the other equipment (mail machine, folder, inserter) your 
    vendor is recommending for you.</p>
    <p>Obviously the only exception to these savings is the additional costs related to meter ink, printer toner, and postage,
    but all in all, cost management is a very powerful reason to leave your processing in-house.</p>
    <h3>Mailpiece Address Quality</h3>
    <p>When you keep your customer communications in-house, you have complete control over customer address updates and 
    corrections. Believe it or not, there are some outsourcing companies out there 
    who abuse their paid-by-piece policies by continuing to send out Undeliverable as Addressed (UAA) mail for 
    their customers month after month so they can maximize their profit margins. At Blazar, we believe this practice 
    is in direct conflict with our obligation to provide the best technology possible for our customers.
    Regardless of whether we're working with one of our outsource, in-house, or hybrid customers, we set
    up business rules for each job designed to accomplish one simple task: getting your customer communication documents from Point A to
    Point B as efficiently and cost effectively as possible. The software we install for in-house applications 
    can be set up to automatically forward all mail to a customer's new address as listed by the USPS National Change of Address 
    (NCOA) and other advanced methods we build into our products. If you must continue sending mail to old addresses for legal reasons, 
    we can do that, too. Either way is fine with us and in both cases we provide your IT staff with a CSV file of customer moves and 
    address corrections we have uncovered so they can review the information and update your host database at their convenience.</p>
    <h2>OUTSOURCING</h2>
    <h3>Why Outsource?</h3>
    <p>Most companies still have investments in internal document print and mail facilities whether or not it's their most efficient option,\
    but the tide is rapidly changing. Why is document outsourcing growing so rapidly?</p>
    <h3>Reduce Costs</h3>
    <p>The most obvious reason companies consider document outsourcing is to reduce capital investment and ongoing expenses for laser 
    printers, mail machines, meter ink, toner, software, and personnel &ndash; all of which are utilized on a part-time basis.
    Strong outsourcing partners offer state-of-the-art production facilities, allowing you to pay only for your company's usage with no 
    long term contracts.</p>
    <h3>Concentrate on Core Competencies</h3>
    <p>Every day, successful companies are becoming more focused and specialized than ever before. Sales and revenue growth are 
    critically important&ndash; building fixed overhead is not. Today, many organizations recognize there is no competitive 
    advantage in building and managing their own print and mail operations; especially when print and mail will diminish over time 
    with our ongoing transition to electronic documents. Furthermore, very few companies can afford to hire full time 
    staff to research and stay on top of technology changes in laser printing, mail production software and equipment 
    and postal regulations. Evaluating, purchasing and implementing electronic document technology creates even more expertise 
    requirements. Blazar Communications finds its success in possessing the necessary specialized expertise to help your company 
    stay at the top-without worrying about micromanaging your own processing centers.</p>
    <h2>IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
    <h3>Space and Equipment Capacity</h3>
    <p>Does your company have the space for the amount of mailing equipment necessary to efficiently process and send out your own documents?
    Do you have high capacity printers that can deliver the volume of information you need to send out?</p>
    <h3>Volumes</h3>
    <p>Are your volumes consistent throughout the year or will you need more information printed during peak seasons than your everyday 
    processing equipment can handle? Is your company growing or shrinking? At Blazar we look at the big picture.
    Is having and maintaining all the gear in-house the best choice for your company over the course of a five year lease?
    Or is the ROI you're looking at today going to change next year due to a major push to securely email customer communications documents?
    We help you determine the best processing management for your company, no matter what volume you need handled.</p>
    <h3>Postage</h3>
    <p>Postal cost control is a prime reason that many customers implement vendor supplied and USPS approved postal discounting software for 
    their first class and promotional customer communications. In many cases, the postal discounts captured from the USPS match a significant 
    portion of the lease payment for the other equipment (mail machine, folder,inserter) your vendor is recommending for you.
    In some cases, this is such a significant savings that many mailing equipment vendors use postage savings ROI's to completely 
    justify the purchase and&frasl;or long term lease of the system they are recommending. Blazar wants to see your company obtain 
    the best gain in profits possible&ndash; and we'll help you find it.</p>
    <h2>BLAZAR'S CALL TO ACTION</h2>
    <p>It's easy to see there are pros and cons to both in-house processing and outsourcing and it can be difficult to determine which 
    one you should consider. We don't pick sides when it comes to what is best for you and your company because we can set up whichever 
    system will prove most successful for you today and next year. At Blazar, we offer both solutions along with hybrid SaaS programs
    so our account reps can get away from persuading you toward something you don't need for the benefit of their own paycheck.
    Instead, we focus on recommending a low cost, high quality solution that's best for you and your unique application.</p>
    <h3>Why Quote with Blazar?</h3>
    <p>Usually, price quotations are based on what your company is doing currently. Instead, Blazar will perform a comprehensive gap 
    analysis comparing your current process with the best in-class standards for your industry. Blazar will produce more than one 
    quote &ndash; we'll give you one that compares apples to apples, one with recommendations for improvements and related costs 
    which will demonstrate how to reduce production costs, and one to show you the potential benefits of leaving your process in-house
    with process enhancement recommendations. The extra time we take to look beyond pricing and focus on your company's needs and 
    capabilities will pay off quite nicely and ensure a mutually successful relationship! 
    Contact Blazar to get in touch with an account representative who will help your company become its most successful&ndash; today!</p>
